Modified to visualize data from

Osgood, G. J., Kennedy, L. A., Holden, J. J., Hertz, E., McKinnell, S., & Juanes, F. (2016). Historical diets of forage fish and juvenile pacific salmon in the strait of Georgia, 1966â€“1968. Marine and coastal fisheries, 8(1), 580-594.

Data have been massaged and wrangled to add biomasses of prey, not just frequency of occurrence.
